GitAI is an interactive chatbot application that allows users to enter a GitHub repository URL and interact with a chatbot to ask questions about the repository. Built using the LangChain framework and GPT-4 model, GitAI leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-aware answers based on the contents of the repository.
